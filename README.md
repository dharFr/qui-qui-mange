# Qui-qui-mange #

A small Node.js application build to 'automate' lunch organisation for our team. And yes, I know it's a bit pathetic...
  
## Initial specification ##

* Every team member has to register his email adress on http://{host}/subscribe
* Every morning (at 10:30), all the registered team members will receive an email to remind them to vote for today's restaurant
* One hour later (11:30), the restaurant which gathered the most votes is chosen from the list and one team member is randomly picked to make the reservation. The guy will receive an appropriate email as a notification.

## Current status ##

'subscribe' an 'vote' pages are done.
